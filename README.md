**RAG Model for QA Bot** ü§ñ
_Automating Question Answering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation_

üìñ Description
---------------
The RAG Model for QA Bot is a Python-based project that leverages the power of retrieval-augmented generation to build a robust question answering system. This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate way to answer user queries by combining the strengths of information retrieval and generative models. The project is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various domains and applications, making it a valuable tool for developers, researchers, and businesses alike.

The project's core component is the `yardstick_assignment.py` file, which contains the implementation of the RAG model. This file provides a comprehensive framework for building, training, and evaluating the model. The model is designed to take in user input, retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, and generate accurate answers. The project also includes tools and scripts for data preparation, model training, and evaluation, making it easy to get started and deploy the model in various environments.

The RAG Model for QA Bot has numerous applications, including but not limited to, customer service chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation systems. The project's modular design and flexible architecture make it an ideal starting point for developers and researchers looking to explore the capabilities of retrieval-augmented generation in question answering. With its robust performance and adaptability, the RAG Model for QA Bot has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with machines and access information.
